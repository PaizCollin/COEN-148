COEN-148: Computer Graphics

Santa Clara University, Prof. Yuan Wang, Fall 2021

Assignment 1 - Circle Drawing Algorithm: Use the mid-point circle drawing algorithm to draw a circle, use the scan fill algorithm to fill the circle, and use an anti-aliasing technique to create a smoothing effect

Assignment 2 - Using the provided data files (one containing 3D point coordinates, the other containing 3 indices that make up a triangle) display the points in 3D space and as well as the wireframe

Assignment 3 - Create a scene with multiple spheres and light source(s) and implement the raycasting algorithm to display the objects with the appropriate lighting properties.
